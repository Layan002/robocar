# About
This project is a big one and considered as a graduation project, I completed it through two weeks in the summer of 2024 which is the duration after finishing the sophomore year (3rd year in university and 2d year in collage). it is a RoboCar that detect object and chang its direction. many components are integrated wether softwere or hardware. 


# Photos of the project: 
All the project is design by me. nothing is paid for any expert to help. Even the application on android which is not my feild I researched for a way to create it and succeeded. 

## Assembly on SolidWorks

# Demo
Here is a video to take you with my journy in building 'The RoboCar" a speeded video of my designing for mechanichal and electronics part from scratch.<br>

Here I've tested the car in my college between my colleagues

# Parts used:
 
## Sofrtware 
### SolidWorks
To design the mechanical part such as Chassis and the pyramid I used SolidWords, which is a CAD for best experience for industrial designs. 
### Arduino IDE
To write the code for all the components connected to the Microcontroller of the Arduino Uno. They are all integrated by my skills in programming. I did not use any open source to write my code, just depending on my knowledge. Finally achieving the goal.

## Hardware
- Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)
- Motor Driver (H-bridge with two outputs)
- 2 DC motors
- 1 Servo motor
- Ultrasonic HC-04
- Blutooth sensor HC-05
- 2 Wheels
- 2 lithium Bettaries (4V for each one)
- bettary holder
- 9 Volts Bettary
- Male-male wires
- male-female wires

## Mechanical
- PLA white filament
- Color spray (Yellow and Green)
- 3D printer (I have AnkerMake M5 & M5C)
> [!NOTE]
> Some people or companies offer 3D priting servicis you do not to have printer if you think you do not need to use them.


>[!NOTE]
> For privecy I did not upload the Arduino IDE code or STL files og the robocat to protect my working from stealing.
